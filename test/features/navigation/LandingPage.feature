Feature: APP Launch landing page

	As a user,
	I would like to navigate through the landing page
	So, I can move to home page of the app

	Background:

	Scenario: can see the landing page of app
		Given I am on landing page
		Then I see the acknowledgement message "Tennis Australia acknowledges that the AO is held on Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Country and we extend our respects to Elders past and present and to all First Nations People."
